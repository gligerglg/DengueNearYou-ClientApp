# DengueNearYou-ClientApp

This project is for the people who need to get updates about Dengue threats near your location. 
The client application let you know the number of dengue patients, 
the number of deaths and the Risk level in your nearest location.

#Importance

According to wikipedia, Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne tropical disease caused by the dengue virus. 
Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection. 
This may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash. 
Recovery generally takes two to seven days.
If you are going somewhere you should need to know the dengue risk in each location. 
You can ask from a responsible person from each location but this cannot be done practically. 
But if you do use the app you can easily get information in real time.

#Technologies Used by the App

This application developed by using Android Studio which is free and 
open source development tool for all the android app developers. To store the lecture entries, 
I used SQLite database which is a  built-in database implementation comes with every Android OS 
and it supports all the relational database features. Apart from that Google Firebase real time database
is used for the application because the data always should be updated.
